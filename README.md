Oxygen Crystal Diamond - ocd ... or KDE4 Oxygen v4.6.2, Crystal Diamond and Crystal Project Icons ported for Plasma5. 

Beware, that the package is a big one. Contains all the folder themes released until then for oxygen, which can be found in intl folder. 

Has few issues, which i will try to fix.

Suggestions are very welcome.

PS: Arch Linux, Netrunner, Manjaro and other Arch-based distros can use the repo:
