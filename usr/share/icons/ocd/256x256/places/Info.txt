Oxyfolders is just a little extra to complement the Oxygen Icon Theme, giving more personalization to the folders in your desktop.

This pack contains PNG 256x256 and looks nice from 48x48 to 256x256 (less than 32x32 don't), but you can find some minor graphic errors.

All artwork here is original from the Oxygen Icon Theme*, developed by The Oxygen Team and licensed over LGPL, and this pack is just a mixture of that work under the same license. You can found the Oxygen Homepage here:

Oxyfolders 0.2 is made from oxygen-icons-4.3.98 (KDE SC 4.4 RC3) and you can found here:
